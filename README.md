# Wine Quality Prediction
Wine quality prediction is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. While subjective in nature, wine tasting follows a structured process that allows for a detailed analysis of a wine's characteristics, including appearance, aroma, taste, and finish. This practice combines both art and science, requiring both knowledge and experience to fully appreciate the complexities of different wines.

This project is executed using machine learning with python. This project is done in Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network course and various libraries in python 

The process contains Data analysis and visualization in which we get the statistical measures of dataset .
Then comes finding the correlation and data preprocessing in which we separate data and label 
Finally comes binarizing labels itno 2 values and model training the evaluation
Lastly comes the predictive system analysis which guesses the quality of the wine
